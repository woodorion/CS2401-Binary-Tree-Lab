Orion's Notes:
-Change how values are stored. Distance of a node should represent the distance and direction from it's parent, not of root.
--Seem to have fixed the issue, except that east is negative, instead of west.
--This has broken the search function, must be fixed
--When reporting distance between two points, do necessesary addition/subtraction at each step.
- look at methods: printEntire, mapHeight if time allows
